 * This is our abstract game input handler.
 *
 * Each frame, we'll collect input data from all of our supported input adapters,
 * and turn it into game input. This game input can then be used by the game
 * update for the frame.
 *
 * The input adapters give us data like "key X pressed", or "right mouse button
 * clicked", or "button B" pressed, and these are translated into a game input
 * like "dodge".
